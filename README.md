Project Description (React Native Mobile App) This project is a basic mobile application built using React Native. The main goal of the code is to demonstrate a general understanding of mobile development fundamentals with React Native, including component creation, use of props and state, styling with StyleSheet, and basic user interaction. The code has been intentionally simplified to focus on core structure and functionality, without relying on complex logic or third-party libraries. This makes the app easy to read, understand, and extend. Some features such as navigation, asynchronous data fetching, or persistent storage were deliberately excluded or minimized to keep the focus on foundational concepts. The project can serve as a learning example for beginners or a starting point for building more advanced React Native mobile applications.
